#  Aviation Accident Analysis

##  Overview

This project analyzes aviation accident data to identify patterns, uncover safety risks, and generate actionable recommendations for aviation stakeholders. 
Using Python (Google Colab) and Tableau, I cleaned, explored, and visualized aviation incident data to support real-world decision-making.

##  Business Understanding

**Stakeholders**:
- Aviation safety managers and policy teams
- Aircraft manufacturers and insurers

**Key Business Questions**:
- What are the most common causes and conditions for aviation accidents?
- Do weather, aircraft type, or number of engines correlate with injury severity?
- Which areas or seasons have the highest safety risks?
- How can data insights guide safety improvements?

## Data Understanding and Analysis

**Data Source**:
- [Aviation Accident Data - NTSB](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khsamaha/aviation-accident-database-synopses)  
- File used: `AviationData.csv` (cleaned and filtered in Colab)

**Data Description**:
- 80,000+ rows across multiple years
- Key features: `event.date`, `weather.condition`, `aircraft.damage`, `total.injuries`, `aircraft.category`, `location`, `number.of.engines`

### Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering:
- Removed outliers from injury totals and number of engines
- Created new variables like Total injuries, I split date to month and weekly encoding
- Handled missing values with statistical imputation and classification-based techniques

## Conclusion

### Key Findings:

*High Number of Uninjured Passengers in Many Incidents
Insight:
*In many incidents, no injuries are reported despite aircraft damage.
Interpretation:
Suggests good safety procedures or aircraft design.
Track aircraft types with high survival rates to inform fleet decisions.

### üîÅ Business Impact:

- These findings support scheduling **pre-summer inspections**, enhancing **pilot retraining**, and reviewing **aircraft type-based risk**.
- The dataset also helps prioritize **high-risk regions** for targeted safety campaigns.
